        At Jamii Vizuri CommunityHealth, We provide the same high-quality health
        care as the area’s leading hospitals and medical centers – because our
        volunteers come from the same settings. Patients can expect to develop
        an ongoing relationship with their medical workers as we work to ensure
        they have the support and information needed to get healthy and stay
        healthy.
